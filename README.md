## ⚡ Fun Fact
Did you know that ice skating blades are only about 4mm wide? This narrow surface allows skaters to achieve high speeds and make those incredibly sharp turns. As someone who appreciates both the art and science of motion, I find ice skating to be a perfect blend of physics, finesse, and fun!
